# Windows Subsystem for Linux shell scripts for day-to-day use
**wsl-scripts**

**Windows Subsystem for Linux script-collection (in progress)** \
**I designed these to make life easier working from a terminal, in Windows, from a bash terminal.**
\
These scripts are made for use in, foremost, a Debian WSL system. Any distribution derived from Debian (E.g Ubuntu) should work just as well.

Each script will contain a description, instructions and extra information that will be useful for users with little to no experience using Linux, or specifically, Linux-based shell terminals on a Windows system.

I make it a priority to ensure these scripts lack any features that can be damaging to less experienced users; in other words - feel free and safe to try 'em out, even if you don't really know what you're doing - thus if you find anything to the contrary, let me know so I can correct it.

**Enjoy**
